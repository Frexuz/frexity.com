### Notes

- Print double-sided when applicable to save paper.
- Print in black and white if you don't need originals with color.
- Keep personal printing low. If you need a big print job, ask your manager.
- Keep in mind that toners cost 800HKD each, and there are 4 of them.

But best of all, ask yourself if you really need to print. Email and the cloud always win :P #environmentfriendly
